# Left-Leaning-Red-Black-Tree
Data Structures and Algorithms Project 2

This project included implementation of a Left leaning red balck tree. 
1. Creating a Node class from scratch
2. Creating LLBT data structure with the following functions
A)Put- Inserting a key-value pair while maintaining the properties of the tree
B) contains key, contains value function that returned the values and keys from the tree
C)Celing key, Floor key, Higher key and Lower Key
D) clear function that uses java garbage collector to clean teh tree
E) equals Method that checks if two trees have the same mappings
F) toString method printing the key-value pairs using Breadth first transversals.
